## The Golden Rule: 

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1) **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**
1) **Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
1) **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?** 
1) **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"**
1) **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?**
1) **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done**
1) **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:
- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
- Consider your data model. 
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need? 
  - What are the key/value pairs? 
  - What arrays might you need? 
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)

HTML SETUP
- 3 dropdowns
    WHY? - user can select the image they want
    HOW? - <select> and <option>
- 3 div's for images
    WHY - to display image user selected
    HOW - background image of DIV?
- input for slogan
    WHY - so user can type in a slogan
    HOW - <input>
- button to submit slogan
    WHY - so we can grab the value of the input
    HOW - El.value
- div to show counts
    WHY? - to display number of times each thing changed
    HOW - a function that takes the count of each and displays a string with each
- div to show slogans
    WHY - to display array of slogans generated
    HOW - for/of to loop through array and add a <p> to the div with the value in each array (each slogan)

EVENTS
- On change of any dropdown
    - get the value of the dropdown element
    - use the value to change the div or img image
    - update the count for that dropdown
    - update the DOM with new count
-On click of slogan button
    - get the value entered in input
    - push into array of slogans
    - update the DOM by
        - reset old slogans from DOM (immutable)
        - loop through array
        - create <p> with content of each index of array and append to slogan display div


STRETCH GOALS

Add the option for the user to name the city and store the name in state. Display that name in big letters at the top. Additionally, when displaying slogans, every slogan should have the name of the city concatenated before it, like so: 'Portland: the city that works!', 'Portland: the big apple'.

HTML
Input for User City Name.
Button to Submit City Name
Display of City Name

EVENTS
When user clicks button it stores the name in state and displays it in a header

Change Slogan event listener so it concatenates the City name stored in state in front of the displayed slogan
